Without seeing the specific requirements from the PDFs you're referring to, I can't create a precise Django model for a Frame.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a general example of how you might structure a Frame model in Django, which you can then modify based on your specific requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Frame(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    width = models.FloatField()\n    height = models.FloatField()\n    depth = models.FloatField()\n    material = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    color = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    style = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)\n    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n\n    class Meta:\n        ordering = ['-created_at']\n```\n\nThis example includes some common fields that might be relevant for a Frame model:\n\n- name: A CharField for the frame's name\n- width, height, depth: FloatFields for the frame's dimensions\n- material, color, style: CharFields for the frame's characteristics\n- price: A DecimalField for the frame's price\n- created_at and updated_at: DateTimeFields to track when the frame was added and last updated\n\nYou would need to adjust this model based on the specific requirements in your PDFs. This might involve:\n\n1. Adding or removing fields\n2. Changing field types\n3. Adding relationships to other models (e.g., ForeignKey, ManyToManyField)\n4. Adding custom methods\n5. Specifying any constraints or validators\n\nIf you can provide more specific information about the requirements, I'd be happy to help you refine this model further.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":139}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":116},"start":148,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":140}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":117},"start":2016,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":141}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Django Frame model creation","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"},{"range":{"start":3,"end":15},"icon":"Folder","label":"levers/task"}]}
