An import for the `path` function from django.urls\n2. An import for the views from the current directory\n3. An `app_name` variable for namespace\n4. A `urlpatterns` list with several common URL patterns:\n   - A root path for an index view\n   - A detail view with an ID parameter\n   - A create path\n   - An update path with an ID parameter\n   - A delete path with an ID parameter\n\nRemember to adjust this according to your specific needs:\n- Replace 'your_app_name' with the actual name of your Django app\n- Ensure that the view names (like `index`, `detail`, etc.) match the actual view functions in your `views.py` file\n- Add, remove, or modify paths as needed for your application\n- If you're using class-based views, you might need to use `views.ViewName.as_view()` instead of just `views.view_name`\n\nIf you need a more specific `urls.py` file, please provide more details about your project structure and requirements.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":26}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":41,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":27}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":1621,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":28}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Django URLs Configuration Example","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}
